# Rick and Morty Tribute Page

This project was made as a tribute to one of my favorite shows "Rick and Morty". I did it to practice API calls with fetch, async-await, React.useReducer, React Portals and React.useContext, additionally I used some Ant-Design components.

I plan to expand project in the future, but this is it for now. =)

I had fun creating this and I hope you like it!
